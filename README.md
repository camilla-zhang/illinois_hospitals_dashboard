# Illinois Hospital Financial Dashboard
## Project Overview
___
This project takes 2019 financial healthcare [data](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Illinois_Hospital_Financial_Data/8018555/1) from Illinois to visualize the disparities between public and private health care using Tableau. We show that cities with a high revenue also have a high density of patients. Furthermore, there while there are more patients with public health insurance than those who pay through a private means, hospitals make much more from private pay patients.
